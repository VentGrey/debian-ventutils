# popy-tools
This is a collection of tools I use to manage my .deb based distributions
when I install one.

These are designed to make things more bearable on Linux.

## Included Files

These tools are divided into categories, depending on their use. Most programs
will be placed under the `bin/` directory, however I might also add some
submodules or small console programs I've made for simplifying the
process of some things.

## Disclaimer

These files were built for my personal use so they may change or get deleted
at some point in time. Also some of them contain swearing in them, if you don't
like cursing, please don't use this.
